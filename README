DREAM VAULT
This is a full stack web app where you can log your dreams :)

When I have a dream I want to remember, I have always just texted it to my friends. These dreams were always getting lost in my messages though and I never saw most of them again.

In my free time while I search for a software engineering job, I figured I might as well make an app that I could benefit from, while learning important lessons on development.

AWS is hosting this entire project. The frontend is managed through Cloudfront and S3, the backend uses Docker with Node.js on Elastic Beanstalk, and the MySQL db is stored on RDS. 

User passwords are hashed, but dream data is NOT encrypted yet. Do not store sensitive information on Dreamvault.

Thanks for checking it out!
