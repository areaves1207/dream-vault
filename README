DREAM VAULT
This is a full stack web app where you can log your dreams :)

When I have a dream I want to remember, I have always just texted it to my friends. These dreams were always getting lost in my messages though and I never saw most of them again.

In my free time while I search for a software engineering job, I figured I might as well make an app that I could benefit from, while learning important lessons on development.

This app currently uses React, Typescript, and CSS in the front end. Node.js + express are going on in the backend, and MySQL is used for the database.

The next steps are to containerize it and then host it with AWS.
