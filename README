DREAM VAULT
This is a full stack web app (and potentially mobile app in the future) where you can log your dreams :)

When I have a dream I want to remember, I have always just texted it to my friends. These dreams were always getting lost in my messages though and I never saw most of them again. 

In my free time while I search for a software engineering job, I figured I might as well make an app that I could benefit from, while learning important lessons on development.

This app currently uses React, Typescript, and CSS in the front end.
